# hw3-password-generator

## Description

This was my first project in JavaScript and it provided some valuable insight. The language is both easier and harder than I previously thought.

The importance of pseudo code became paramount throughout because it's hard to write code or even look up possible function types without knowing each little piece you're trying to solve. It taught me to look at projects in smaller chunks rather than sitting down and immediately being concerned over the totality of the end result.

Through perseverance and a lot of Googling, I've now built a tool I can hand off to friends or use to set my own passwords in the future.
